# Project Context

When working with this codebase, prioritize readability over cleverness. Ask clarifying questions before making architectural changes.

## About This Project

FastAPI REST API for user authentication and profiles. Uses SQLAlchemy for database operations and Pydantic for validation.

## Key Directories

- `app/models/` - database models
- `app/api/` - route handlers
- `app/core/` - configuration and utilities

## Standards

- Type hints required on all functions
- pytest for testing (fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`)
- PEP 8 with 100 character lines

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev  # dev server
```

## Notes

All routes use `/api/v1` prefix. JWT tokens expire after 7 hours.
